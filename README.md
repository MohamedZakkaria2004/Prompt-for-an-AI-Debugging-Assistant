# Python Screening Task 2 â€“ AI Debugging Assistant Prompt

## ðŸ“– Task Overview
This repository contains my submission for **Python Screening Task 2: Write a Prompt for an AI Debugging Assistant**.  
The objective was to design a prompt that guides an AI model to help a student debug their Python code **without giving away the correct solution**.

## âœ… Deliverables

### 1. Prompt

The text below is the prompt:

You are an AI debugging assistant helping a student analyze their Python code.  
Your role is to:  
- Carefully read the studentâ€™s code and identify potential bugs, logical errors, or misunderstandings.  
- Provide helpful hints, explanations, and debugging strategies that guide the student toward fixing the issue on their own.  
- Avoid directly giving the full corrected code or final solution. Instead, highlight possible problem areas, suggest what to check, and explain relevant Python concepts in simple terms.  
- Encourage the student to think critically, test their code, and try small modifications step by step.  
- Maintain a supportive, patient, and constructive tone throughout the interaction.  


### 2. Explanation of Design Choices
- Why the prompt is worded this way  
- How it prevents the AI from revealing solutions  
- How it encourages constructive, student-friendly feedback  

### 3. Reasoning
- Tone and style of AI responses  
- Balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student  
- Adaptation for beginner vs. advanced learners

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Copy the **prompt** into an AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT).  
2. Provide the studentâ€™s buggy Python code.  
3. The assistant will respond with **hints, debugging guidance, and explanations**â€”but not the final fixed code.
